The objective of this work is to develop the most efficient (considering accuracy in the probability of prediction and the computational requirement) architecture for face recognition classifier using Multilayer Convolutional Networks for face identification, Facenet in Keras which generates the embeddings and finally a classifier optimized using stacked and Super Learner ensembles comparing the performance of both with different datasets.
For that have been combined the best performance algorithms in each of the 3 steps, in face identification (MTCNN), creating the embeddings (Facenet) and finally creating a stacked classifier with machine learning (Stacked and Superlearner) looking as a combined accuracy higher than 90%
Facial recognition is key in sensible infrastructures like Nuclear, Water, Power plants, Petrochemicals, Refineries etc so the goal is creating an algorithm that can be used to fasten the access and the security in these key facilities which has a flow of thousands of people daily being key the accuracy and velocity as this will represent an enhancement of the productivity and security in installation that cannot afford any risk because the social and healthy risks that they represent.
As an average for a facility with 1000 operators in removing the input lathe we calculate a saving of 30 seg in getting in and 30 seg in getting out of the plant which means 1000 minutes per day, 22000 minutes per month and 264000 minutes per year (4400 hours)
As a conclusion has been created an algorithm with levels of accuracies higher than 90% which requires low computational charge as it leverages the most efficient algorithms (State of art on each step) and pre-trained models. This can be used not only for sensible infrastructures but as well for marketing campaigns in which personalize the customer experiences when faces are recognized with this level of accuracy in stores or any center that concentrate a limited number of people.
